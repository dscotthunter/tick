## Tauhid's Lab Group Version of Tick 
I am kind of playing around with the awesome tick package that can be found (here)[https://github.com/X-DataInitiative/tick]. To download this version of tick, I reccomend doing doing the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/dscotthunter/tick.git
git submodule update --init 
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace bdist_wheel
```
Let me know if you have any problems with this. I am just kind of playing around with this package, so I will keep everyone updated as I go.
